I have used the same testing as testFunctionality.
For the coloring enhancement, I don't know how
to get coloring on these files so I have just
tested by looking at them.

And the reason for using the same test is because
the results won't be different. The only extra test 
will be the reverse display. Insert was already a thing
for the singly list, so using the same test is valid.
