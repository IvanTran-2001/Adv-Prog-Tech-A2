Tests are run the same as expected in Milestone 1, they are just saved in folders to reduce clutter.

    ./ppd stock.dat coins.dat < testing/<testname>/<testname>.input > testing/<testname>/<testname>.actual_ppd_out
    diff -w <testname>.output <testname>.actual_ppd_out
    diff -w -y <testname>.expcoins <actual_ppd_save_coins>

        - where applicable there may be .expstock to ensure that the stock file is updated appropriately
        - There may also be alternative stock and coin files to test cases where these are set to alternative values
        - Where stock and/or data was not intended to be updated, they may be removed from testing
            - In the cases where the defualt stock or coin file was used, these were reset between tests
